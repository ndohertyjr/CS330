How do I approach designing software?

I approach software design by gathering a list of the requirments and breaking them down into different objects to create.  From there, I think of what functions each object will need to do.  The design skills in this project required that I think of each literal object in the scene and determine how they would fit together, so it was nice visual representation of how I think about abstract objects.  I broke each shape into the most basic shape it could be and combined them together.  I tried to make the code as modular as possible to allow for parts to be reused independent of the shape it was creating.  The tactic of making the code modular is very useful and I will apply it in future work.

How do I approach developing programs?

The strategies I use when developing programs is similar.  I aim to make the code for the program be modular so the program runs efficiently and is versatile.  I created iterations that began by making sure the basic functionality worked and progressively added more features until the final product was ready.  My approach to coding evolved throughout the milestones but making sure that individual features worked before moving onto the next.  Previously I would try to do a little bit of everything, but as I progressed in the project, I realized it made more sense to make sure one aspect works entirely before moving to the next.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

As for my educational goals, I intend to work towards a Master's degree, potentially in AI.  By being able to develop visualization to show how my AI progresses in its training and problem solving, I will be able to quickly see what works and what doesn't without having to dive through each epoch's data.   In my professional goals, I'm not sure how much visualization and graphics I intend to use.  I believe that we are on a precipice of more aspects of our lives becoming VR/AR so being able to design graphics will likely become even more valuable than it is now.  Understanding how it works will make me a more marketable asset in the future.
